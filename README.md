## Version Control (Git)


Generally, we will create a new git branch for each new feature. This is a good practice because in the future if we further update the branch after some discussions, the pull request will be automatically updated. Let's create a new branch to make a very simple change to amend the readme.md file:

```
git checkout -b myfeature develop
```
After making the relevant additions to build the new features, we will just commit the new changes and checkout to the git develop branch:
```
git add .
git commit -m "myfeature info"
git checkout dev
```

#### Incorporating a finished feature on develop Â¶

```
Switched to branch 'dev'
$ git merge --no-ff myfeature
Updating ea1b82a..05e9557
(Summary of changes)
$ git branch -d myfeature
Deleted branch myfeature (was 05e9557).
$ git push origin dev
```
